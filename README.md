Cancer is one of the leading causes of human morbidity and mortality worldwide and we want to find new ways to detect it.AI is changing how we do clinical diagnosis of tumors. In this paper, when A.I. The study shows how important it is to use deep learning models like CNN to look at tons of image 
data.Using clever techniques including record enhancement, switch detection and model tweaking, this study seeks to improve the accuracy and speed of analysis It also looks at issues related to the use of AI in hospitals, a knowledge of how AI makes choices is included and It also ensures a good match 
between data and how doctors have already created the model.
